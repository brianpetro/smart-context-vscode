# Smart Context: Local, Open-Source Code Context Solution

**Smart Context** is an open-source VS Code extension that gives you full control over how you manage and copy text from your projectsâ€”without ever leaving your local environment. It respects `.gitignore` and keeps your **private code secure**, unlike cloud-dependent alternatives like uithub.com.
